### This is a general principles style guide for writing beautiful code

## Outline
- Script header (general and libraries)
- Variable names
- Function names
- Function parameters and output

#### FYI
The code below is an example of how to create multi-line comments in `MATLAB`. This is only a preference so don't feel compelled to use it. Using this method you cannot write in the same line where you begin/end the mutli-line comment. 
```matlab
%{
Hello, World!
This is a mult-line comment in MATLAB.
%}
```
